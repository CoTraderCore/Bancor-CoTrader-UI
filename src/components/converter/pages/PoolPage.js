    <Card.Text>
    To own part of any token's exchange, add liquidity to that token's pool.
    </Card.Text>
    <Card.Text>
    When you do this, you'll receive a relay token (aka smart token), for that pool.
    </Card.Text>
    <Card.Text>
    For example, to own part of the COT exchange, you'll deposit both:
    </Card.Text>
    <Card.Text>
    BNT and COT
    </Card.Text>
    <Card.Text>
    You'll receive the relay token for COT, called COTBNT.
    </Card.Text>
    <Card.Text>
    This relay token, COTBNT, is bought up whenever COT is traded, which raises its price.
    </Card.Text>
    <Card.Text>
    Relay tokens like COTBNT are also speculative assets. They can be bought and sold separately in the "Relays" tab.
    </Card.Text>

    More updates coming soon.
